If you are interested in trying out Kotlin for AoC this year or even next, check out [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/6-XSehwRgSY) from the Kotlin team. They provide helpful tips for Kotlin functions that help with several past AoC problems, instructions for their AoC giveaway, and a GitHub project template to help you get started!
